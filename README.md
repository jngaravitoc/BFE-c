BFE-c
==========

The code computes coefficients of the [Henrquist](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJ...386..375H/abstract) Basis Field Expansion from snapshots of N-body simulations. 
At the moment, the code only reads outputs from Gadget. 

The code is wirtten in C and it can run in parallel. 

Tools:
------

1. Read Gadget snapshots.
2. Compute COM of the snapshots.
3. Compute coefficients.
4. Compute noise of the coefficients.
